## 1. CLI interactive shell command surface

- Phase: `phase-5-cli-tooling / tool-surfaces`
- Priority: `P3`
- Owner: `cli`
- Size: `large`
- Contract status: `draft`
- Contract: Map Scrapling's interactive shell concepts into a Go command surface with scripted evaluation first, before any full REPL dependency.
- Ready when: Static CLI extract behavior is stable.
- Not ready when: The row tries to build a full interactive REPL before scripted command fixtures exist.
- Write scope: `cmd/goscrapling/`, `internal/cli/`, `internal/cli/testdata/`
- Test commands: `go test ./... -run TestCLIShell -count=1`
- Acceptance: Scripted shell fixtures prove command evaluation and page shortcut behavior without live web access.
- Done signal: Shell command tests pass from local fixtures.
- Source refs: `references/Scrapling/scrapling/cli.py`, `references/Scrapling/docs/cli/interactive-shell.md`, `references/Scrapling/scrapling/core/shell.py`, `references/Scrapling/scrapling/core/_shell_signatures.py`

## 2. Public docs, examples, and API reference parity

- Phase: `phase-5-cli-tooling / tool-surfaces`
- Priority: `P3`
- Owner: `docs`
- Size: `medium`
- Contract status: `draft`
- Contract: Maintain Go docs/examples for parser, adaptive scraping, fetchers, browser fetching, spiders, CLI, MCP, and migration guidance mapped from upstream docs.
- Ready when: Core APIs have stable examples for each subsystem.
- Write scope: `README.md`, `docs/`, `example_test.go`
- Test commands: `go test ./... -run TestExamples -count=1`
- Acceptance: Examples compile and docs point each major upstream feature group to a Go status or owned exclusion.
- Done signal: Example tests and docs checks pass.
- Source refs: `references/Scrapling/docs/index.md`, `references/Scrapling/docs/overview.md`, `references/Scrapling/docs/tutorials/migrating_from_beautifulsoup.md`, `references/Scrapling/docs/tutorials/replacing_ai.md`
